# Test Processing with Python

In this text processing project, I used Python to analyze a passage on AI and ML by cleaning the text, converting it to lowercase, and removing special characters. I then counted the frequency of each word using the “Counter” function from the “Collection”  library, identifying the most common words. This project demonstrates text cleaning, word frequency analysis, and extracting key themes from text using Python.
